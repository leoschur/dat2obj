# dat2obj

This is a python script to convert Lithtech \*.dat (DAT) map files to Wavefront obj files. There are limitations to this conversion. A conversion of the vertices and faces is rather simple but texturing, shading and also logical grouping is not that easy. I will try to support more later on. Converting back is not an option due to high complexity required.
